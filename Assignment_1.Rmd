## CFA to construct a measurement model for the Attitude items
There are `r sum(str_detect(colnames(cosmetics),"Attitude"))` attitude items that are scored on a five-point Likert scale. 

## CFA to construct a measurement model for the Behavior-Intention items
There are `r sum(str_detect(colnames(cosmetics),"BI"))` attitude items that are scored on a five-point Likert scale. 

## Structural equation model to evaluate the impact of attitude on behavior intention

# Task 2

```{r load2, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
load(find_root_file("data/benefits.Rdata", 
     criterion = has_file("MultivariateStatistics_assignment.Rproj")))
